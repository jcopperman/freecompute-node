# The Free Compute Movement

> A sovereign, local-first stack for South Africa — and the Global South. No dollars. No rent. No permission. Just compute we own.

## ⚙️ The Free Compute Stack – Core Layers

| **Layer**           | **Goal**                                       | **Example Tool(s)**                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ⚡ **Power**         | Off-grid, solar-first micro-DCs                | DIY solar + LiFePO₄ + Inverter      |
| 🌐 **Networking**   | Peer mesh, offline-first, LoRa or LTE fallback | Tailscale, IPFS, LoRaWAN, ZeroTier  |
| 🧠 **Compute**      | Run containers and VMs on local hardware       | Linux (Debian), Proxmox, Docker     |
| 🗃️ **Storage**     | Redundant, decentralized object & file storage | MinIO, Nextcloud, Syncthing         |
| 🧱 **App Platform** | Deploy self-hosted services or APIs easily     | CapRover, Dokku, Coolify            |
| 📊 **Analytics**    | Monitor health without surveillance capitalism | Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma    |
| 🔐 **Auth**         | Federated, secure identity and access control  | Authentik, Keycloak                 |
| 🧠 **AI**           | Local language, voice, and vision intelligence | Ollama, Whisper, DeepSeek, Phi      |
| 🔁 **Federation**   | Nodes sync data, mirror services, share load   | GitOps (Flux), Tailscale, Syncthing |

## 🎯 What This Is

This is not an anti-cloud movement — it’s an **anti-rentier** movement. We’re not trying to copy AWS. We’re rejecting its **economic model**.

This is for:

- Devs who can't afford USD tokens
    
- Schools that need offline services
    
- Clinics that want secure, local-first storage
    
- Creators who want to self-host on their own land
    
- Communities that want sovereignty without surveillance
    

We are building **locally-owned**, **solar-powered**, **ZAR-priced**, and **globally federated** infrastructure from the dust up.

## 🛠️ What We’re Building First

### `freecompute-node`

A micro data center blueprint you can run in a garage, shack, classroom, or solar container:

- < R15,000 hardware BOM
    
- Solar-powered
    
- Full service stack (Git, S3, DB, App runner, Dashboard)
    
- Peer-connectable via Tailscale/IPFS
    
- Includes integrated AI services (Ollama + Whisper + vision)
    
- Documented, shareable, forkable
    

Then we build more. One node becomes many. Many nodes become **a free mesh of sovereign compute**.

## 📡 The Movement

- **Own your compute.**
    
- **Host your tools.**
    
- **Share the stack.**
    
- **Price in Rands.**
    
- **Say no to rent-based tech.**
