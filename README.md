# The Free Compute Movement

A sovereign, local-first stack for South Africa and the Global South.
No dollars. No rent. No permission. Just compute we own.

## The Free Compute Stack

| Layer          | Purpose                                         | Examples                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Power          | Off-grid and resilient where it matters most    | Solar, LiFePO₄, inverter setups  |
| Networking     | Peer-to-peer and offline-friendly               | Tailscale, IPFS, LoRa, ZeroTier  |
| Compute        | Local machines that run containers and services | Debian, Proxmox, Docker          |
| Storage        | Redundant and owned file and object storage     | MinIO, Nextcloud, Syncthing      |
| App Hosting    | Easily deploy your own tools and services       | CapRover, Dokku, Coolify         |
| Monitoring     | Stay informed without being watched             | Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma |
| Access Control | Secure sign-in and federation                   | Authentik, Keycloak              |
| AI             | Local voice, language and vision tools          | Ollama, Whisper, DeepSeek, Phi   |
| Federation     | Nodes that sync, mirror and share as needed     | GitOps, Tailscale, Syncthing     |

## What This Is

This isn’t a rejection of the cloud.
It’s a rejection of how the cloud is owned, priced and controlled.

It’s for people who’ve been left out:

* Developers who can’t afford dollar-priced tokens
* Schools that need services even when the internet goes down
* Clinics that want secure, local data without surveillance
* Creators and communities that want to host their own tools
* Anyone tired of paying to use their own machines

The stack is built to be **resilient to power and connectivity outages**.
It runs fine off solar, works offline when needed, and supports fallback comms like LoRa or mesh networking.

We’re building something practical.
A stack you can run in your garage, your classroom, or your co-op.

## What We’re Building First

**`freecompute-node`**
A micro data center you can run on your own terms.

* Under R15,000 total build
* Can run on solar or grid
* Comes with object storage, database, app runner, dashboards
* Connects to others over Tailscale or IPFS
* Includes local AI: text, voice, and vision
* Easy to document, fork, or remix

One node is all it takes to start.

## The Principles

* Own your compute
* Host your tools
* Share the stack
* Keep pricing in Rands
* Build with others, not over them
